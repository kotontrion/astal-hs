# astal-hs

These are haskell bindings for the [astal libs](https://github.com/Aylur/astal) generated using [haskell-gi](https://github.com/haskell-gi/haskell-gi).

# Todo
- [ ] publish to hackage (i would like to wait for the first official release of astal first)
- [ ] examples
- [ ] adding a wrapper to add some QOL features
